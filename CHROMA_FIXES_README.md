# ChromaDB Connection Issues & QnA Bar Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the "Could not connect to tenant default_tenant" error and improve the QnA bar positioning.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ChromaDB Connection Error
**Problem**: The backend sometimes showed "Could not connect to tenant default_tenant" when taking time to process requests.

**Root Cause**: 
- ChromaDB connection issues during high load or timeout scenarios
- Lack of proper error handling and connection retry logic
- Missing timeout management for long-running operations

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implemented proper error handling for ChromaDB operations
- Added timeout management for all async operations
- Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Added health check endpoint

### 2. QnA Bar Positioning
**Problem**: The QnA bar in the summary section was not properly positioned.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed QnA bar to bottom of screen using `fixed bottom-0` positioning
- Added proper spacing to prevent content overlap
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
1. **`app/services/rag.py`**
   - Added connection retry logic
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Added logging for debugging
   - Improved vector store management

2. **`app/routes/wiki_routes.py`**
   - Added timeout management for all operations
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Better user feedback for connection issues

3. **`app/main.py`**
   - Added health check endpoint
   - Global exception handler
   - Enhanced logging

### Frontend Changes
1. **`frontend/src/pages/Results.tsx`**
   - Fixed QnA bar to bottom of screen
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Added retry functionality
   - Better timeout handling

## New Features

### 1. Health Check Endpoint
- **URL**: `GET /health`
- **Purpose**: Verify API status and diagnose connection issues
- **Response**: API health status and timestamp

### 2. Connection Retry Logic
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Maximum 3 retry attempts
- Configurable retry delays

### 3. Timeout Management
- Wiki fetching: 60 seconds
- Content processing: 30 seconds
- Vector store creation: 60 seconds
- Summary generation: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- QnA responses: 60 seconds

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Specific error codes for different failure types
- Retry buttons for failed operations
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Testing

### Run ChromaDB Connection Test
```bash
python test_chroma_connection.py
```

This script will:
- Test ChromaDB connectivity
- Verify database operations
- Create test database if needed
- Provide detailed diagnostics

### Test Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "API is running normally",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Connection Issues Persist

1. **Check ChromaDB Directory**
   ```bash
   ls -la chroma_db/
   ```

2. **Test ChromaDB Connection**
   ```bash
   python test_chroma_connection.py
   ```

3. **Restart Backend Server**
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Start again
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Clear ChromaDB and Restart**
   ```bash
   rm -rf chroma_db/
   # Restart server
   ```

5. **Check System Resources**
   - Available disk space
   - Memory usage
   - No other processes using the port

### Common Error Messages

- **"Request timeout"**: Backend is taking longer than expected
- **"Vector store not available"**: Need to fetch a topic first
- **"Failed to establish ChromaDB connection"**: Database connection issue
- **"Backend error"**: Internal server error, check logs

## Performance Improvements

- **Parallel Processing**: Summary generation runs in parallel
- **Connection Pooling**: Better ChromaDB connection management
- **Timeout Handling**: Prevents hanging requests
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry for transient failures

## Monitoring

### Logs to Watch
- ChromaDB connection attempts
- Vector store operations
- Request timeouts
- Error patterns

### Metrics to Track
- Request success/failure rates
- Average response times
- Timeout frequency
- Connection retry counts

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Connection Pooling**: More robust ChromaDB management
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascading failures
3. **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring
4. **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation
5. **Backup/Recovery**: Database resilience

## Support

If issues persist after implementing these fixes:

1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Run the connection test script
3. Verify system resources
4. Check for conflicting processes
5. Consider database corruption and reset if necessary

**Note**: These fixes significantly improve the reliability and user experience of the WikiSummarizer application. The QnA bar is now properly positioned and connection issues should be much less frequent.
